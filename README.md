## About
Communication can be a major challenge for certain children. Parents, teachers, and friends can struggle to connect with them, leading to strains in these adolescent relationships. **Crimson** hopes to change that. Our product promotes innovative communication strategies, helps develops interpersonal connections, and aids those with communication disabilties. But how?

There are two major components:
1. **The Crimson Cube**

A 15cm by 15cm toy/aid that records and sends data to a web application. Through interactions with the cube, a user can express their feelings, thoughts, desires and answers to questions. Someone who is normally apprehensive with expressing themselves can feel more comfortable since they are communicating implicitly instead of explicitly.

Communication Features:
- 4 coloured buttons where the user can control their current mood and set 'mood intensity' by turning the button.
- A toggle switch to answer 'yes' or 'no' to questions asked.
- A fidget tracker that measures emotions like anxiety and restlessness.
- A 4-setting dial that indicates action items like sleep, eating, sleeping and quiet time.

2. **The Interactive Application**
